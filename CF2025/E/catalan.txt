You are given n numbers from 1 to n
1 2 3 4 .. .n
-> n is even

Make 2 different sets of numbers (and keep them sorted)
x1 x2 .. x_n/2  y1 y2 ... y_n/2

each of 1 to n is exactly in one set

such a pair of set is called good if  x_i < y_i for all i [1..n/2]

the result is the n / 2 th catalan number

1 2 5 14 42 ...
